This book created by Patrick Bills in 2023 based on experience using databases and SQL since 1986 in an academic environment, starting with dBase III on MS-DOS 3.1.

### List of Technology Used:

Quarto: https://quarto.org markdown with active code blocks, used to write this book.  

SQLite: https://sqlite.org/index.html 

DuckDB: NextGen Analytical Database : https://duckdb.org

R API for DuckDB : https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r.html 

SQLDF : https://github.com/ggrothendieck/sqldf an R package for easily running SQL statements on R data frames

Most R-Database packages are based on the the R DBI interface:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/index.html

Quarto SQL extension for SQLite: https://github.com/shafayetShafee/interactive-sql  (and SQLite only)

R dbPlyr: https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org the database backend for [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org).  This library is not SQL, but it is another approach to pulling data from tabular data.
