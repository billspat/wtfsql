Researchers in all disciplines have to manage tremendous amounts of data, but many have large collection of files of various formats such as CSV text files, spreadsheets, lists, even images, maps, movies, etc.

We've heard of database and of the SQL language that works with databases and want to learn more.

SQL is the common language used to interact with "Relational" databases. Relational database excel at organizing tabular data and reading data from it at unbelievable speed.

The goal of this book is to provide all the background information someone doing research in any field (sciences or humanities). Not all academic work is 'research' but nonetheless could use a system to quickly query a large colleciton of information to find or summarize. A library card catalog for example is an extermely helpful database. Faculty, staff and students don't have time or resoruces to purchase commerical database systems. There are many many introductions to the SQL language which focus on pulling data from it. Few provide the complete picture of exactly what you need to complete your research. How do you create the database to hold your information, and how to get your information into the database. Some of focused on a specific brand of database but that may not be the best fit for what you need to accomplish.

Some of the questions academic left to answer are:

Database seem great to query my data, but how do I get my data into a database in the first place?

How can I enter data as I am collecting it into a database.

How can I use a database only on my laptop without having to purcahse any other hardware? That is, do I need a server? How much will everything cost? What are some really low cost ways to to share my data with my collaborators with with the world?

How can I share the database with my collaborators?

Can multiple people use the database at the same time, or could have some helpers entering data while others are reading data?

What are some guidelines for building a database structure for my data?
