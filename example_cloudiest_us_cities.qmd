This is a walk through of a case-study for determining a problem/question, designing the database to answer the question, pulling data into a database, and answering the question.

I often hear that my city (Lansing, MI) is 2nd cloudiest in teh country.  Then I heard the same thing from another city (I don't recall which).  who doesn't like a sunny day?  So which are the cloudiest cities in the country?
